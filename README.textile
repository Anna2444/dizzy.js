h2. Usage

h3. SVG

h3. Javascript

h2. Browser support

This table sums up some results I got from testing presentations with different browsers/versions.
Support mainly depends on the used rendering-engine for SVG (the JS part is pretty well supported).
I've used a simple presentation with some transformations, images, embedded HTML and MathML for testing.

See "Browser support":http://github.com/Moerphy/dizzy.js/wiki/Browser-support in the wiki


h2. To do
